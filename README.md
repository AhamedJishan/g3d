# G3D (Ganit 3D)

## Overview

G3D Maths Library is a C++ mathematics library developed to support 3D graphics programming. It provides essential mathematical operations and data structures commonly used in this field. As I delve into learning 3D mathematics and programming, this library serves as both a practical application of my knowledge and a showcase in my resume/portfolio.

### What is 3D Mathematics?

3D mathematics involves the study and manipulation of geometric entities such as points, vectors, and matrices in three-dimensional space. It forms the foundation of various applications, including computer graphics, computer-aided design (CAD), and physics simulations.

## Features

### Vectors
- **vec2 & vec3 (vec4 upcoming)**: Represent vectors in 2D and 3D space.
- **Magnitude & Normalization**: Calculate vector magnitudes and normalize them.
- **Dot & Cross Product**: Compute dot and cross products for vectors.
- **Angle Calculation**: Find angles between vectors.
- **Arithmetic & Logical Operations**: Support basic operations.
- **Output Stream Overload**: Simplify vector output.

### Planned Features
- Support for matrices and more advanced mathematical operations.

## Current Status

**Note:** This library is currently under active development. Key components and features are being actively worked on, and the API is subject to change.
